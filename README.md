Calendar Booking App

Assumption:
-> I have assumed that week starts from Monday so for April 2024, 2nd day of 3rd week will be on 16th April and for Aug 2024, it will be on 20 Aug.

Areas of improvement:
-> Writing Integration Tests.
-> Tests on validators & utilities
-> Logging
-> More robust check with bad inputs such as 'ADD 15/04 11:))'
-> Should have refactored Program.cs to follow SRP
-> Should have fixed all the warnings in Test project.
